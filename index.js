// I need to assign three calculations to variables
// I need the results of those calculations to equal 10, 40, 39
// I need to create the message "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:"
// I need to create an alert/dialog box that displays the vault code and the text


// Step One - Create three calculations to equal vault code 10, 40, 30
// Calculation one:
const oneCode = 5 + 5;

//Calculation two:
const twoCode = 20 * 2;

// Calcuation three:
const threeCode = 40 - 1;

// Step Two - Create the display message
const impMessage = ("You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:" )

// Step Three - Create dialog popup
alert (impMessage + " " + oneCode + "," + twoCode + "," + threeCode)


// Display message about workshop
console.log ("This is my  Block 7 workshop")
